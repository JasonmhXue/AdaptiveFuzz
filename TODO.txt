This file contains notes about bugs and feature requests for Adaptive Fuzz.



BUGS:
- 4/14/2017
    Unmarshaling arbitrarily fails sometimes.  It has useless error messages, and I'm not sure what the deal is.
- 4/14/2017
    Gradient descent currently doesn't type check for some reason ... likely having to do with recent
    changes to the partial evaluation system.
- 6/24/2016
    I have some anecdotal (but not reproducable) evidence that the sensitivity checker may return NaN.
    I've made an attempt to address this, but as I have no test case to run it on, I'm not sure if it's
    a bug anymore or not.

Feature Requests:
- 1/25/2017
    Add random sampling (secrecy of the sample).
- 2/23/2016
    Add better type inference.

Ideas to improve performance
- 1/25/2017
    Use profiling to improve performance.  See http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-400/manual031.html
    For starters: Start a run with the big database, and then kill it once it creates its piece.  Recompile the piece with the
    profiler, and see what happens.  Use this data to inform what should be optimized.  Potentially:
    - Primml.vectorbagFromFile should generate vectors directly.
    - Vector operations should maybe be able to do in-place updates?  As is, vmap, vperformat, vzipwith all allocate new arrays.
    - Add labeledVectorBagFromFile, which automatically returns a bag of ('a, 'a vector) elements.
    - Remove uses of vcons and vuncons in code -- it's super slow -- and then remove the functions altogether.
    - Avoid uses of vectorToList and listToVector wherever possible
- 1/20/2017
    It would be great if the database could be kept in memory between calls to runfuzz.  Is there some way to share this?
    It might mean that, instead of running a new ocaml process for each call to runfuzz, we have one curator process and
    channels to communicate between the analyst and curator.  This would mean we have to do some sort of "eval" to run the
    code though (possibly preventing compiler optimizations).  It's not clear if that's worth it.

Code Beautification:
- 2/22/2016
    When primitive functions are interpreted, they can create new terms (e.g. result terms).  However, the current implementation 
    does not carry file info into primfun interpretation, so the terms are all lacking this data.  The interpretation of primfun 
    should be updated to take a fileinfo as an argument so that produced data and error messages are better.  This will affect 
    types, interpreter, and prim (and likely some other files as a side effect).
- 2/22/2016
    Primitive function definitions are put into the program during the interpretation phase (Interpreter.lookup_prim).  This means 
    that prior to this, primfuns are reliant upon a simple string to differentiate them from each other.  Really, this string 
    should only be for debug purposes.  To fix this, I anticipate passing the primfun list to the parser and having the syntax 
    tree be constructed with primfuns directly.  This will likely affect types, parser, and interpreter (and likely some other 
    files as a side effect).
- 2/22/2016
    There are two monads used in this codebase, the checker monad for type checking and the interpreter monad for interpreting.  
    They are quite similar, but there is no monad module to allow sharing of similar functions (e.g. mapM, mapMSi, mapMTy, etc.).  
    This seems silly and rectifiable, but I don't quite know how to do it in ocaml.


Extended Documentation for in-code comments
- 4/10/2017 FIXME in src/primml.ml (readCmemFromFile)
    If the curator memory is not able to be read properly, the system will silently convert it to None.  This seems overly
    restrictive but probably isn't too bad.
- 2/23/2016 FIXME in lib/primitives.fz (p_sample)
    The sample operator is currently implemented as syntax because of the lack of type inference support.  Once type inference 
    is added, this could be changed to a primitive.
- 2/23/2016 TODO in src/math.ml
    The system may be vulnerable to floating point related attacks, and the way to address this may be to do our own 
    probability calculations (which are used for add_noise).
- 2/23/2016 TODO in src/parser.mly (extend_var)
    The Ctx module has been extended with extra support for adding variables to the context, but the parser is not yet making 
    use of this support.  Updating this shouldn't change any visible outputs, but it may make debugging the parser (after 
    future changes, say) easier.  Also, it's just a little cleaner and more elegant.
- 2/23/2016 TODO in src/parser.mly (Term: LET)
    The parser should probably throw an error if you try to write "let (x,x) = ...", but right now, it accepts it just fine.
- 8/16/2016 NOTE in src/syntax.ml (tmEq)
    PVals are compared on structural equality only.  That is, two distributions may be indistinguishable but not equal.
